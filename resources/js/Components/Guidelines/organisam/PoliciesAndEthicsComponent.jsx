            <h5 className="mt-4 fw-bold">Multiple Submission</h5>
            <p>
                Papers presenting essentially the same research should not be
                published in multiple journals, and concurrent submission to
                multiple journals is deemed unethical. Certain articles (e.g.,
                clinical guidelines, translations) may be published in more than
                one journal under specific conditions, with agreement from
                authors and editors, reflecting the same data and
                interpretation, and proper citation of the primary document.
            </p>

            <h5 className="mt-4 fw-bold">Plagiarism Policy</h5>
            <p>
                All journals published by Westland Publishers are committed to
                disseminating solely original material, ensuring content that
                has not been previously published or is concurrently under
                review elsewhere. As part of our commitment to maintaining
                scholarly integrity, Westland Publishers employs plagiarism
                detection tools to identify instances of overlapping and similar
                text in submitted manuscripts. Manuscripts determined to have
                been plagiarized from other author(s), whether from published or
                unpublished sources, will be subject to plagiarism sanctions.
            </p>

            <h5 className="mt-4 fw-bold">Unethical Citation Practices</h5>
            <p>
                Manuscripts submitted to Westland Publishers employing citations
                with the primary aim of artificially inflating the citation
                count for a specific author's work or articles from a particular
                journal will be subject to citation manipulation sanctions.
            </p>

            <h5 className="mt-4 fw-bold">
                Fabrication and Falsification of Data
            </h5>
            <p>
                Submitted manuscripts to Westland Publishers found to have
                fabricated or falsified experimental results, including image
                manipulation, will face sanctions for data fabrication and
                falsification.
            </p>

            <h5 className="mt-4 fw-bold">AI Generated Content</h5>
            <p>
                Plagiarism, the unethical use of others' work without proper
                credit, remains a significant concern in academic circles. While
                AI writing tools can generate text of human quality, they lack
                the capacity for independent research and critical thinking.
                Relying solely on AI to produce research papers raises
                authenticity concerns, rendering them unsuitable for credible
                publication. Authentic research requires human involvement for
                critical analysis and interpretation. Moreover, the use of AI in
                research presents ethical challenges, including the risk of
                biases from training data and questions regarding authorship and
                accountability. To address these issues, collaborative efforts
                between AI systems and human researchers, rigorous quality
                control, and transparent attribution are essential. Westland
                Publishers prioritizes these measures to ensure ethical
                standards are upheld.

            <h4 className="mt-4 fw-semibold">Conflict of Interest</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Author Disclosures :</strong> Authors submitting
                articles to Westland Publishers are required to provide a
                comprehensive conflict of interest disclosure. This encompasses
                both financial and non-financial interests, affiliations, as
                well as personal, racial, and intellectual properties. Notably,
                authors funded by a company producing the discussed products
                must transparently acknowledge this, recognizing its potential
                influence on their manuscript.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Reviewer Responsibilities :</strong> Reviewers are
                expected to disclose any affiliations that place them in the
                same research area and competing with the authors. The potential
                influence on judgment is acknowledged, and the guidelines
                emphasize the importance of avoiding advising the rejection of a
                competing article solely to expedite the publication of their
                own research.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Editorial Integrity :</strong> Editors at Westland
                Publishers are reminded that receiving an article from a friend
                or colleague may introduce bias in their judgment of its
                suitability for publication. The guidelines stress the
                importance of maintaining impartiality and ensuring fair
                evaluations in the editorial process.
            </p>

            <h5 className="mt-4 fw-bold">Statement on Informed Consent</h5>
            <p>
                Westland Publishers aligns with the guidelines outlined in the
                Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical
                Journals: Writing and Editing for Biomedical Publication.
            </p>
            <p>
                To uphold patient privacy, Westland Publishers ensures that
                patient identifiers are not published unless explicit written
                informed consent is obtained, and the information is deemed
                essential for the scientific purpose and merit of the
                manuscript. In cases where photographs reveal recognizable
                features of subjects, a signed release authorizing publication
                is required. This requirement also extends to case reports that
                provide sufficient unique identification of an individual (other
                than their name) to enable recognition. Failure to secure
                informed consent from a patient before submission would result
                in the rejection of the manuscript.

                Addressing Errors in Published Works
            </h5>
            <p>
                Authors are obligated to promptly inform Westland Publishers of
                significant errors, engaging in collaborative efforts to rectify
                issues through the publication of an erratum or, if necessary,
                the retraction of the paper. In cases where third parties
                identify substantial errors, authors bear the responsibility to
                address and correct the errors promptly.

            <h5 className="mt-4 fw-bold">Duties of Westland Publishers</h5>
            <p>
                In instances of alleged or proven scientific misconduct,
                fraudulent publication, or plagiarism, Westland Publishers
                collaborates with editors to thoroughly investigate and clarify
                the situation. This may involve the prompt publication of an
                erratum or clarification, and in severe cases, the retraction of
                the affected work. Both the publisher and the editors are
                dedicated to implementing reasonable steps to identify and
                prevent the publication of papers where research misconduct has
                occurred, thereby upholding ethical publishing standards.

            <h5 className="mt-4 fw-bold">Advertising</h5>
            <p>
                All the journals provide free advertisement to the Universities
                or Institutes for their events. The advertisements should match
                the journal scope and it will be beneficial to the readers. In
                most of the cases, we will display advertisements about the
                journal.

                Editors may recommend that a manuscript aligns better with

                Withdrawal Policy at Westland Publishers

            <p>
                At Westland Publishers, we uphold the utmost integrity in the
                publication process and expect authors to adhere to stringent
                ethical standards. The withdrawal of a manuscript, whether under
                review or already published, can result in the inefficient use
                of valuable resources and efforts by our esteemed editorial
                board members, reviewers, and editorial staff.
            </p>
            <p>Outlined below is our withdrawal policy:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Authors are required to confirm that all data and facts
                    presented in the manuscript are original and solely their
                    own. In cases where information from other sources is
                    utilized, authors must have obtained appropriate written
                    permissions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Manuscript withdrawal after submission is permissible only
                    under the most compelling and unavoidable circumstances.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Authors seeking withdrawal are requested to communicate
                    their request, providing comprehensive reasons for the
                    withdrawal.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Westland Publishers explicitly states that withdrawal
                    charges may be applicable, contingent on the status of the
                    article, as stipulated in our policy.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                If you decide to withdraw your manuscript within the initial 48
                hours of submission, there will be no financial penalties
                imposed on you or your co-authors. This grace period allows
                authors to reconsider their submission without any financial
                repercussions.

            <p>
                However, once your manuscript has been accepted for publication
                and the Article Processing Charge (APC) has been processed, it
                signifies a significant step forward in the publication process.
                Unfortunately, in line with our policies, we are unable to offer
                refunds for the APC if you decide to withdraw your article after
                this point. This policy ensures fairness and transparency in our
                handling of publication fees and resources allocated to
                manuscript processing.
            </p>
            <p>
                We sincerely appreciate the cooperation of authors in upholding
                the ethical standards integral to scholarly publishing.
