            <h5 className="mt-4 fw-semibold">Defining Peer Review</h5>
            <p>
                Peer review constitutes a rigorous evaluation process where subject experts assess the quality, validity, and originality of research papers before publication. It involves impartial scrutiny by independent researchers who possess in-depth knowledge of the subject matter. The primary objective is to guarantee the publication of only high-quality and reliable research.
