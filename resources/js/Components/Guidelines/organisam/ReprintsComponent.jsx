                Reprints are exclusively generated upon special request and prior discussion with the authors through email.
                Charges for reprints are determined based on factors such as article size, page limit, postal address, and the number of copies required for individual articles.
                Reprints are made available only after the article has been published and the Article Processing Charges (APC).
